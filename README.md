1. [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html)  
The ZIP file format is a common archive and compression standard. This module provides tools to create, read, write, append, and list a ZIP file. 
1. [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)  
This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or write a file see open(), if you want to manipulate paths, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in all the files on the command line see the fileinput module. For creating temporary files and directories see the tempfile module, and for high-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.
1. [fpdf](https://github.com/reingart/pyfpdf)  
PyFPDF is a library for PDF document generation under Python, ported from PHP.  
1. [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)

The email package attempts to be as RFC-compliant as possible, supporting RFC 5322 and RFC 6532, as well as such MIME-related RFCs as RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2183, and RFC 2231.
